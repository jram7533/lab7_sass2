		<h1>Seven Essential Tools</h1>
		<h2>SASS</h2>
		<p>
			<img class="float-left sm" src="images/sass.png" alt="jquery logo"> Web dev tools that save time are your best friend and one of the first things you'll learn about code is that it needs to be DRY (&quot;Don't Repeat Yourself&quot;). The second thing you'll probably learn is that CSS is usually not very DRY.
		</p>
		<p>
			Enter the world of the CSS preprocessor, a tool that will help you write maintainable, future-proof code, all while reducing the amount of CSS you have to write (keeping it DRY).
		</p>
		<p>
			Perhaps most popular among them is <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, a nineteen-year-old open-source project which pretty much defined the genre of modern CSS preprocessors. Although a little tricky to get to grips with initially, Sass's combination of variables, nesting, and mixins will render simple CSS when compiled, meaning your stylesheets will be more readable and (most importantly) DRY.
